This case study explores the integration \nof  variable  frequency  drivers  and  remote-control  \ntechnology to enhance the management of AHUs, resulting \nin substantial energy savings and operational efficiency.\nProject  Background:  The Gurugram offices of SBI Card \nare  equipped  with  16  AHUs,  responsible  for  maintaining  \noptimal temperature levels across various floors. These \nunits  collectively  consume  approximately  9,00,000  \nkWh  of  electricity  annually,  representing  a  considerable  \noperational cost and environmental impact.\nObjective: The  primary  objective  of  this  initiative  was  \nto  reduce  energy  consumption  and  associated  costs  \nby  optimising  the  performance  of  the  AHUs  without  \ncompromising indoor climate control.\nImplementation: In collaboration with Building Owner, SBI \nCard upgraded the AHUs with variable frequency drivers \nand  installed  remote  controls  at  the  control  panels.  \nThe  new  technology  adjusts  the  AHU  motor  speeds  by  \ndetecting the air conditioning temperature on each floor, \nensuring  the  maintenance  of  the  desired  temperature  \nwith enhanced precision and efficiency.\nOutcomes: The  automation  upgrade  has  led  to  a  \nsignificant reduction in energy usage, with an estimated \nsaving of around 90,000 kWh of electricity per annum. \nThis equates to a ~73.800 tCO\n2\ne emissions reduction per \nannum from the decrease in energy consumption for the \nAHUs, reflecting SBI Card's commitment to sustainable \noperations and cost-effective resource management.\nImpact: The initiative not only contributes to SBI Card's \nsustainability goals but also demonstrates the potential \nfor large-scale energy savings in commercial buildings. \nBy adopting such smart technologies, SBI Card is setting \nan industry benchmark for environmental responsibility \nand operational excellence.\n50\nSBI Cards and Payment Services Limited"

The  survey  responses  were  extrapolated  to  \ncalculate details related to employee commuting. Each mode \nof transportation used by employees is matched with CO₂ eq/\nkg factors from the India GHG program databases, based on \ndistances between homes, workplaces, and vice versa.\nGHG Emission Reduction:\nOur  dedicated  journey  towards  reducing  greenhouse  gas  \n(GHG) emissions and minimising our environmental footprint \nis  a  testament  to  upholding  the  trust  of  our  stakeholders  \nbestowed upon us.

These measures are a cornerstone of \nour mission to reduce emissions and exemplify our commitment \nto the trust placed in us.\nCultivating  Trust  Through  Employee  Empowerment:  Our \nemployees  are  ambassadors  of  our  environmental  ethos,  \nand  their  engagement  is  pivotal  in  lowering  our  collective  \ncarbon  footprint.  We  invest  in  this  belief  by  conducting  \nregular awareness workshops and training sessions designed \nto  empower  our  employees  with  knowledge  and  skills  in  \nsustainable  practices.  Through  these  initiatives,  we  foster  a  \nculture of environmental responsibility where each employee \nis  encouraged  to  contribute  meaningfully  to  our  carbon  \nmitigation efforts.\nWe  remain  committed  to  being  a  trustworthy  leader  in  \nenvironmental  responsibility  while  delving  our  efforts  with  \nthe same zeal and transparency that our stakeholders and the \nplanet deserve.\nCARBON NEUTRALITY\nWe  are  deeply  committed  to  combating  climate  change  and  \nachieving  carbon  neutrality  by  FY  2030.  Operating  within  \nleased premises presents challenges in controlling our energy \nsources  directly.

We  have  identified  the  need  to  address  this \nproblem to enhance our sustainability efforts.\nSolution  Implementation:  We  have  initiated  a  food  \nwaste  recycling  program  in  collaboration  with  the  \nbuilding  management.  The  process  involves  the  \ncollection and decomposition of organic waste, which is \nthen converted into nutrient-rich fertiliser. This fertiliser \nis  used  to  nourish  the  planters  located  throughout  the  \nbuilding and office floors.\nOutcomes and Impact:\nThe   food   waste   recycling   initiative   has   had   a   \nsignificant impact:\n\n Effective  Waste  Management:  Streamlined  the  \nmanagement  of  food  waste  through  recycling  and  \ncomposting,  reducing  the  amount  of  waste  sent  \nto landfills.\n\n Resource  Conversion:  By  turning  food  waste  into  \norganic fertiliser, the initiative has created a valuable \nresource, contributing to the building's greenery and \npromoting a circular economy.\nThe  initiative  exemplifies  how  sustainable  practices \ncan  lead  to  positive  environmental  change  and  \nresource efficiency.\nEmployee   Engagement:   We   promote   environmental   \nresponsibility  among  the  workforce  through  educational  \ncampaigns, training sessions, and interactive activities focussed \non sustainable waste management and recycling.\nE-Waste  Management:  In  line  with  our  commitment  to  \nenvironmental  stewardship,  we  have  adopted  responsible  \npractices  for  the  disposal  of  electronic  waste.  In  compliance  \nwith  environmental  regulations,  we  ensure  that  all  e-waste  \ngenerated from our operations is collected and processed by \ncertified recycling firms.

It is followed by extraction of base and higher \nbase metals and refinement of metals into 99.9% purity. This \nstrategy not only enables the extraction of valuable materials \nbut also safeguards against the potential hazards of improper \ne-waste disposal.\nThe  proactive  approach  to  sustainable  waste  management  \nreflects our dedication to environmental conservation and \ntransparency.

Through  \ngreen  product  designs  and  the  promotion  of  digital  services,  \nwe  weave  sustainability  into  our  offerings  and  reinforce  our  \ndedication to a trustworthy future.\nLIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA)\nWe recognise the importance of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in \nevaluating the environmental impact of our products. The LCA \nprocess helps pinpoint significant environmental impacts, gauge \nthe  overall  ecological  footprint  of  our  offerings,  and  identify  \nareas for improvement. \nKey facets of our LCA methodology include:\nPurpose of the LCA Study:\n\n  Quantify  the  environmental  repercussions  from  the \nproduction of SBI Card\n\n  Ascertain  the  environmental  impact  per  unit  for  PVC, \nHololam, and Tungsten Metal Cards\n\n   Identify  primary  environmental  impact  hotspots  within  a  \ncradle-to-gate framework\nScope and Boundary: We conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) \nusing a cradle-to-gate perspective as we do not manufacture \nthe credit cards. This method focusses on the stages from raw \nmaterial extraction to the cards leaving our key vendor's facility. \nBy  concentrating  on  our  principal  vendor,  we  can  thoroughly  \nevaluate  and  understand  the  environmental  impacts  of  the  \nproduction  process,  ensuring  sustainability  throughout  our  \nsupply  chain.  This  assessment  enables  us  to  make  informed  \ndecisions and implement strategies that promote environmental \nresponsibility and trust among our stakeholders. \nImpact  Assessment  Method:  We  utilise  the  ReCiPe  2016  \nMidpoint,  a  renowned  LCA  impact  assessment  method,  to  \ntranslate life cycle inventory data into quantifiable environmental \nimpacts.  This  method  provides  a  comprehensive  view  of  18  \nmidpoint and 3 endpoint indicators, reflecting the severity of \nenvironmental impacts across various categories.\nStandards  Compliance:  We  ensure  our  LCA  study  adheres  \nto  ISO  14040/44  standards  for  international  consistency \nand credibility.\nFindings from the LCA Study:\nOur  commitment  to  environmental  stewardship  is  evident  in  \nour sustainable card manufacturing practices. By repurposing \nor recycling 99% of waste from 100 kg of material input, we \nsignificantly minimise our environmental footprint. Our PVC \nand  Hololam  cards,  designed  with  eco-conscious  principles,  \nreduce global warming impact by 58% and 56% respectively, \ncompared  to  metal  cards.  They  also  show  a  55%  and  51%  \nlower impact on fossil resource scarcity, and a 65% and 64% \nreduction in fine particulate matter formation."

By  actively  listening  to  \nour  employees'  voices  and  taking  action  on  their  feedback,  \nwe  demonstrate  our  commitment  to  their  well-being  and  \nprofessional  growth.  This  focus  on  employee  engagement  \nultimately strengthens our foundation of trust, leading to a more \nsuccessful organisation.\nThe 'iCare' Survey is an internal evaluation managed by \nthe Human Resources team, which is executed every \nquarter targeting employee at the Assistant Manager \nlevel and above. It gathers insights on various aspects \nsuch as Leadership/Supervisor, Work Environment, \nRewards & Recognition, Engagement Index, Work-Life \nBalance  and  Job  Satisfaction.  In  response  to  the  \nfeedback,  an  annual  action  plan  is  formulated  in  \npartnership  with  the  leadership  and  is  diligently  \ntracked and monitored until the following quarter.\nBUILDING A SAFE AND SECURE WORKPLACE: \nCOLLEAGUE HEALTH & SAFETY\nWe believe that a safe and secure workplace is not only essential \nfor physical health, but also lays the foundation for a positive and \nproductive work experience.

This has been a boon \nfor  small  farmers  like  me,  enabling  access  to  machinery  \nat  nominal  charges  that  was  previously  unaffordable”-\nDevender Singh\nIn  North  India,  farmers  typically  burn  crop  residue  after  \npaddy  harvesting  in  October-November  to  save  time  \nand  costs.  This  persists  due  to  limited  awareness  about  \nalternatives and a lack of necessary tools and machinery \nat  the  village  level.  To  address  air  pollution  and  soil  \ndegradation, SBI Card has initiated a sustainable solution \nby providing farmers with farming equipment and offering \ntechnical support.\nDevender Singh, a small-scale farmer with 3 acres of land \nfrom Balona village in Karnal, formerly adopted his father's \npractice  of  stubble  burning  for  convenience.  However,  \nthis  led  to  reduced  yields  and  increased  agricultural  \ninput  costs,  including  higher  urea  usage  and  water  cycle  \ndisruptions.  The  absence  of  necessary  equipment  at  \nCooperative societies and Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs) \nfurther compounded challenges in wheat sowing, given the \nexorbitant machinery prices.\nThe intervention brought about a significant change for \nDevender.

This strategic decision not only diversified his agricultural \nactivities but also promised higher value and stability in income \nthroughout the year.\nThe  shift  to  fruit  cultivation  brought  positive  impacts  beyond  \nfinancial gains. Fruit trees enhanced soil health, increased \nbiodiversity,  and  contributed  to  environmental  conservation  \nefforts. Supported by SBI Card and SankalpTaru, Rohit embraced \nsustainable  practices  like  drip  irrigation,  fostering  ecological  \nbalance while nurturing his orchard for long-term growth.\nWith the success of his guava orchard, Rohit's confidence, and \noptimism  for  his  farm's  future  soared.  His  story  serves  as  an  \ninspiration  to  fellow  farmers,  highlighting  the  transformative  \npotential  of  sustainable  farming  practices  in  improving  \nlivelihoods  and  fostering  ecological  sustainability.

The \nNational Statistical Office (NSO) estimates placed real Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP) growth at 8.2% during the FY 2023-24. \nThis growth is driven by factors such as, increased investment, \ncontinued government focus on capital expenditure, improved \ncapacity  utilisation,  the  services  sector’s  resilience,  robust  \ncredit  growth,  and  healthier  financial  positions  for  both  \ncorporations and banks surpassing the 7.0% growth observed \nin the preceding FY 2022-23. This positive trajectory in Gross \nDomestic  Product  (GDP)  was  strengthened  by  substantial  \ngrowth in the pivotal sectors, particularly the financial, real \nestate, and professional services industry.\nThe  MPC  of  the  RBI  has  sustained  the  policy  repo  rate  at  \n6.5%  during  FY  2023-24  and  maintained  its  'withdrawal  of  \naccommodation' stance. In outlining a well-balanced policy that \nfits with market expectations, the governor reaffirmed the RBI's \ncommitment to maintaining headline inflation at 4%. The RBI has \nprojected an inflation rate of 4.5% for FY 2024-25 as compared \nto 5.4% observed in FY 2023-24. While the overall economic \nperformance is strong, challenges at the bottom of the pyramid \nare acknowledged, particularly in consumption demand, which \nis expected to exhibit a tepid trajectory. In FY 2023-24, headline \ninflation has followed a moderating trajectory. However, food \nprice pressures have occasionally disrupted this decline, even \nas core inflation—which includes both goods and services—has \nshown signs of softening.\nIt  noted  that  growth  in  services  and  industry  is  expected  to  \nremain  robust,  the  latter  aided  by  strong  construction  and  \nreal estate activity. The inflationary pressures are expected to \nsubside, which should create policy space for easing financial \nconditions and therefore interest rates.\nINDUSTRY DEVELOPMENTS\nSeveral macroeconomic factors have contributed to the growth \nof India's digital finance sector in recent years, driven primarily \nby  innovations  from  both  established  and  emerging  players,  \nas  well  as  support  from  governmental  and  regulatory  bodies  \naimed  at  promoting  a  robust  digital  payment  ecosystem.  The  \nproliferation  of  internet  and  smartphone  usage  has  further  \nexpedited  the  evolution  and  adoption  of  digital  payments.  \nMoreover, the increasing digitalisation across key sectors such \nas mobility, e-commerce, and food delivery has boosted the use \nof digital payment methods.\nThe integration of technology-driven solutions has significantly \nenhanced  financial  inclusion,  leveraging  innovative  digital"

The \nobservations were shared with the Statutory Auditors and the \nobservations along with the Statutory Auditors’ comments on \nthe same are stated herein below:\nA. Independent Auditor’s Report:\n CAG observation No. A.1:\n        Companies (Audit and Auditor) Rules, 2014 under clause \n11 (other matters to be included in auditors report) states \nthat the auditor’s report shall also include their views and \ncomments on the following matters:\n        ‘Whether the company has made provision, as required \nunder  any  law  or  accounting  standards,  for  material  \nforeseeable losses, if any, on long term contracts including \nderivatives contracts; and whether the dividend declared \nor paid during the year by the company is in compliance \nwith section 123 of the Companies Act, 2013.’\n    Audit observed the following:\n  i)     The  independent  auditor’s  report  did  not  contain  \ntheir views and comments on whether the company \nhas made provision, as required under any law or \naccounting  standards,  for  material  foreseeable  \nlosses,  if  any,  on  long  term  contracts  including  \nderivative contracts.\n    ii)       The independent auditor has also not commented/\ndisclosed that the company has paid interim dividend \namounting to ` 362.64 crore during the year; \n         Hence, the Independent Auditor’s Report is deficient \nto that extent.\n  Independent  Auditor’s  Response: The observation is duly \nacknowledged. In the current financial year there were no \nlong-term contracts including derivative contracts which \nresults  in  any  material  foreseeable  losses  and  thus  no  \nprovisions were made for the same. Further, in relation \nto interim dividend being an inadvertent manual error of \nomission  of  the  word  \"or  paid\",  we  will  ensure  all  such  \ndisclosures are accurately included in our report and will \ncomment specifically upon the same in future.\nB.

As per the guidance \nnote on CARO, in case where the schedule of repayment \nof  principal  and  payment  of  interest  is  stipulated  but  \nrepayment  of  principal  or  payment  of  interest  is  not  \nregular then the auditor may report the fact and may give \nnumber of cases and remarks, if any. A reference is invited \nto clause (iii) (c) of Annexure 1 to independent auditors’ \nreport which states that the company is a non-banking \nfinancial company engaged in the business of issuing credit \ncard to customers. In respect of loans and advances in the \nnature of loans, the schedule of repayment of principal and \ninterest payment for EMI portion of portfolio is stipulated, \nrest of the portfolio is Non-EMI portion which do not \nconstitute any schedule of repayment. Having regard to \nthe nature of the company’s business and the volume of \ninformation involved, it is not practicable to provide an \nitemized list of loan assets where delinquencies in the \nrepayment of principal and interest have been identified.\n  Further, except for the instances where there are delays or \ndefaults in repayment of principal and/ or interest and in \nrespect of which the Company has recognized necessary \nprovisions in accordance with the principles of Ind AS and \nthe guidelines issued by RBI, the parties in general are \nrepaying  the  principal  amounts,  and  are  also  generally  \nregular in payment of interest, as applicable.\n        During audit scrutiny it was observed that during the current \nyear  the  customers  under  the  EMI  portion  of  portfolio  \ndefaulted against 8526 nos. of the accounts amounting \nto ` 65.90 crore. However, the independent auditor failed \nto report the same. Therefore, the Independent Auditor’s \nReport is deficient to that extent.\n                Independent  Auditor’s  Response:  It  is  essential  to  \nnote that the Company operates as a specialized NBFC \nprimarily engaged in the Credit Card business, where its \ncore products and services involve rendering loans in the \nform of Credit Cards to its customers.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, \neducation sector endured significant impact. To continue the education in a seamless manner, Lotus Petal Charitable Foundation \nproposed the hybrid model of schooling.\nThe SBI Card project supported the development of infrastructure (as per the list of equipment given in the below table) for \nthe hybrid school for 400 students along with operating expenses (teachers’ salary, training & capacity building, rent and \nschool supplies) to meet the needs of the new academic session (for 1067 students). Multiple components were funded \nunder this project, which included both capex and opex support. The list of capex support provided in the LPF school is as follows:\nS. No.EquipmentQuantity provided by SBI Card\n1. Laptop Stand43\n2. Portable floor podium stand – Height adjustable steady standing23\n3. Office guest desk chair with study chair23\n4. Wired headset, stereo headphones with noise cancelling43\n5. Wacom interactive pen and touch display43\n6. Acoustic partition - Sound absorbing desk divider - Desk privacy panel - Sound dampening2\n7. Mouse Pad70\n127 students from class IV to IX were administered with the Self- Administered Questionnaire (SAQ) survey (quantitative).\nKey findings:\nImpact of class using wacom, acoustic rooms and other COVID-19 period activities\nSBI Card had provided support for the class using wacom, acoustic rooms, provision of notebooks & stationary items and \nreimbursement of data packs for internet usage to attend the classes. As per the support provided 2 acoustic partitions have \nbeen created along with equipping the 23 classrooms and 43 teachers with digital aids. The classrooms were equipped with Portable \nfloor podium stand – height adjustable steady standing and office guest desk chair with study chair.\n •It was highlighted by the students that before the SBI Card support, 62% of the students (n=127) faced difficulty in attending \nonline classes during the COVID-19 period. It was reported by 74% of the students (n=127) that they had received data pack \nreimbursement from SBI Card. \n •The  students  stated  that  the  data pack reimbursement was a boon to them during COVID-19 as it enabled  (59%)  and  \nencouraged (32%) them to attend the classes. The students also highlighted that without the support they would have not \nbeen able to attend the classes which would have affected their learning levels.\n •It was reported by 96% of the students (n=127) that they were aware of wacom being used by teachers for taking sessions. \nThe students further informed that the concepts taught were easily understood to them as it was not monotonous like just"

The department had the strategy and infrastructure \nidentified already, the need of an implementation partner and funding was realised. SBI Card initiated the project of providing Home \nCare to asymptomatic and mild symptomatic patients of COVID-19 with Doctors for You (DFY) as an implementing agency. Under \nthis project home care kits, medicines (standard set of medicines given by the Chief Medical Officer’s i.e., CMO office including \nadditional set of medicines for co-morbidity cases, consumables were provided along with human resources and transportation \ncost with the target to conduct home visits and distributing medical kits to 15,000 beneficiaries each. Apart from these, the project \nalso had the component of call center support for incoming and outbound calls.\nKey findings:\nDisaster response and emergency preparedness (Partner Identification)\n •SBI Card’s support through this project ensured reaching out to 11,945 COVID-19 positive patients with medical kits and \ncounselling of approximately 40,449 persons telephonically. Due to decline in number of cases from the month of February \nand March 2022, the leftover kits were donated to the district health office, as reported by the DFY and SBI Card team \nduring interactions."

This enabled the district administration \nto tackle the rising cases of COVID-19 patients.\n •The district health department coordinated between the SBI Card and DFY team for execution of the project. The SBI Card team \nengaged DFY who had the trained field staff with COVID-19 response Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and therefore \nwere able to initiate the programme within a weeks’ time and respond to the disaster adequately.\nReaching effectively through technology-based intervention\n•   As highlighted by the DFY programme team, it was emphasised that the administration had technological intervention in place \nbut due to lack of technical expertise and due to limited manpower in the field during COVID-19 wave I & II, they had to rely \non manual practices as there was no scope of experimentation at that time.\n •With SBI Card’s timely funding and support, the health department could utilise the manpower provided by DFY for the \ndeployment of GC3App during the Wave III. This application with its monitoring and additional layer of case wise data mapping \nof the COVID-19 positive cases helped the district administration to effectively monitor the progress at the field level.\n •The application provided interfaces both for the administration to monitor and for the public to use and connect with any \nrelated medical services such as call centre, hospital support, ambulance support, etc. This interface helped in preparing and \nre-iterate the course of action.\n •Apart from the GC3App, the district administration also had an automated tele calling system in place. With SBI Card supporting \nthe  operational  costs,  project  was  able  to  deploy  10  tele  callers  who were taking the in-bound calls  coming  in  from  the  \ncommunity, handling the queries, further guiding them based on nature of the ask.

The medical kit comprised of \noximeter, digital thermometer, face masks, sanitiser and essential medicines to cope with the infection.\n •The medicines were handed over to the patients post assessing their respective vitals. This approach was proven to be effective, \nas the field teams were not just handing over general medicines to the patients, but instead customised set of dosage were \nprescribed by the doctor post assessing the vitals of the beneficiaries at their doorstep.\n •This customised  approach proved beneficial for the patients to ensure  higher  recovery  rate. The risk of going out and \nspreading infection to family members and in the community was also curbed to an extent by providing all the required \nequipment’s in the medical kit itself.\n •The data gathered from daily monitoring of their vitals helped the patients in making informed decisions instead of acting based \non instincts.\nGenerating awareness and addressing the Stigma\n •Availability of doctors at the ground level, also proved to be a successful model as it helped in reducing the load to an extent \nfrom the hospitals and addressing the stigma around COVID-19.

They have played a vital role in managing the mental and emotional well-being of the beneficiaries \nby helping them to mitigate the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Inclining elderly \nto activities like painting, singing, etc. has given them a motivation and boost to rekindle their interest in hobbies, hence, \npromoting active ageing.\nSoftware for Digitisation of Records\n •For better management and keeping updates the use of web-based MIS software was realised for efficient record keeping. Hence, \nsupport for a digitisation software was sought from SBI Card. However, use of software was opted as a pilot for 6 months as it \nwas based on a limited time subscription-based model. Considering the limitation attached with the subscription-based model, \nimplementation partner translated the best practices from the software to their existing record management methods using MS \nExcel. As a result, efficiency in data management was observed and unique IDs were allotted to the beneficiaries of SBI Card \nwhich improved monitoring of the beneficiaries and the services provided to them. \nKey recommendations:\n •The staff at all levels are well-versed in their roles and have a clear understanding of their tasks.

There are various challenges to pediatric \ncardiac care like financial constraints, health-seeking behavior of community, and lack of awareness especially to beneficiaries \nwho are vulnerable and marginalised.

Additionally, \nthe government hospitals also have prolonged waiting lists ranging from months to years. Hence, to bridge the gap, Sri Sathya Sai \nSanjeevani Hospital has taken up the initiative to treat these children who have limited to no access to quality healthcare totally \nfree of cost. The project was initiated by SBI Card in collaboration with Sri Sathya Sai Health and Education Trust (implementing \npartner) in Baghola, Palwal district, Haryana. The main objective of the project was to expand the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) \nfacility in Sai Trust Hospital to address the long waiting line of patients by purchasing new advance equipment that will be beneficial \nin treating these ill children.\nKey findings:\nAccess to good quality & free of cost healthcare\n •During the interactions with Sri Sathya Sai Trust and SBI Card team, it was highlighted that the equipment support was provided \nin this hospital due to its strategic location and the unmet need for quality & affordable CHD healthcare. Though, some \nhealthcare facilities were available in the vicinity, they were not sufficient to meet the needs of the patients or not affordable \nby the beneficiaries. The trust hospital benefitted the community by providing access, free of cost and quality CHD care to \nthe patients.\n •The equipment support in the hospital has led to increased capacity to treat and accommodate a greater number of patients \nand ensured the timely administration of medical treatment to the CHD patients. The patients could access good quality \nand free of cost CHD care which was difficult to obtain specially for middle- and low-income group who were unable to afford \nhigh-cost intensive treatments from other private healthcare institutions.\n •The quality care provided free of cost saved the lives of the critical CHD patients (309 patients during the project duration, \nDec 2021 to June 2022) which otherwise would have costed higher. As informed by the doctors, nurses, and management staff \nthat the treatment here is free for the beneficiaries.

SBI Card funded the provision of customisable, motorised wheelchair-cum-scooter to 154 persons with locomotor disability. \nThe project supported by SBI Card has contributed towards empowering persons with locomotor disability to facilitate their \nmobility. It was envisioned with an aim to make the target group independent in terms of accessibility, mobility, having a dignified \nstandard of living and earning a living for themselves as well as their families. The beneficiaries supported under this project \nbelong to Economically Weaker Section (EWS) and lower middle class income category.\n8\nThe project was implemented by Round Table India Trust (RTIT) and NeoMotion was the vendor for the customised wheelchair-\ncum-scooter. The project was aimed at making the solution accessible to those who could not afford it, enhance their mobility and \nwell-being and boost their confidence.\nKey findings:\nBeneficiary satisfaction on Product andw Service Delivery\n •Most beneficiaries provided satisfactory feedback to their overall experience with NeoMotion in terms of both product quality \nand service delivery.\n •The beneficiaries (73%) stated that the product customisation experience was hassle free as they had to visit only once for their \nclinical assessment and measurements for the wheelchair-cum-scooter.\n •Those beneficiaries (27%) who could not physically visit had the option to get their assessment done online in a single 30-minute-\nlong session and provide their measurements.\n •During the interactions, 93% beneficiaries reported that the device received was customised as per their needs while \n7% beneficiaries shared that their device needed corrections when they first received it which were eventually fixed by \ncontacting NeoMotion.\n •70% of the beneficiaries rated the device as excellent in quality, 25% rated the device as Good, 4% gave the device an \nAverage rating while 1% rated the device as poor due to wrong device customisation and issues with the delivery of the \nreplacement shipment.\n •49% of the beneficiaries faced issues with the battery or battery charger of the device. This was due to the device being used \nto a much greater extent than anticipated at the time of product design.\nImpact on mobility of the beneficiaries\n •The compact design and easy usability of the wheelchair-cum-scooter by the beneficiaries enhanced their confidence and made \nthem more independent in terms of mobility.\n •Access to the wheelchair-cum-scooter provided the beneficiaries with the opportunity for socialisation, psychosocial well-being \nand enhancement in quality of life.\nImproved confidence of the beneficiaries\n •Using the device has enabled the beneficiaries to challenge attitudinal barriers as they have become less dependent on caregivers."

The efforts to create a skilled workforce to manage COVID-19 was of prime importance for the health \nsector at that time.\nThe efforts to train candidates in the healthcare sector to manage COVID-19 were of prime importance and due to higher conversion \nrate of COVID-19 positive patients there was a requirement for skilled COVID-19 workers in India. Hence, the Ministry of Skill \nDevelopment and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) designed a programme to create a pool of trained/skilled COVID-19 warriors. This \nprogramme is called the Customised Crash Course Programme for COVID-19 Warriors (CCCP for CW), and it was implemented \nunder the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana 3.0 (PMKVY 3.0).\nThe programme had two components: classroom training for 1 month followed by 3 months of On-the-job training (OJT). The \nprogramme was expected to create a pool of skilled COVID-19 warriors who can augment the availability of allied healthcare \nprofessionals in the country and help in coping with the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSBI Card and Payment Services Limited (SBI Card) initiated the project in alignment with the government initiative and contributed \ntowards achieving the larger goal. The programme under evaluation by SBI Card covered four customised job roles: Basic Care \nSupport, Advanced Care Support, Emergency Care Support and Sample Collection Support. The selection of these four courses \nwas based on the demand from the hospitals and clinics within Delhi and Gurgaon (Haryana).\nSBI Card supported Health Sector Skill Council (HSSC) to initiate the project which was intended to train 500 candidates in \nresidential mode on four COVID-19 frontline worker job roles. To implement this project SBI Card signed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding (MoU) with HSSC.\nKey findings:\nCREATING INCOME GENERATION & EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTH DURING THE TIME COVID-19\nReaching out to the beneficiaries\nMobilisation activities were conducted by the training partners of HSSC to promote the project and invite applications from \nthe potential trainees. Respondents were probed on sources of information about the course. 54% reported that they came to \nknow about the training programmes through the Newspaper/TV /radio/internet. Further, 53% of the respondents identified the \nprogrammes through campaigns by HSSC or training institute team.\nEffectiveness of the training programmes\n •89% of the respondents reported that they did not have any income-generating activities before the enrolment to this programme.\n •77% of the respondents reported that they joined the institute to get better placement, and\n •44% stated good faculty and infrastructure were the key aspects in driving them to join the training."

Poor elementary and secondary education results are caused by several factors, \nincluding low accountability and insufficient infrastructure. Lack of modern teaching techniques through smart education and \nsubsequent inadequate infrastructural facilities in government schools often result in dropouts and/or low-performance \nlevels. Therefore, there is a demand for enhanced use of information and communication technologies (ICT) in education.\n10\n SBI \nCard partnered with Yuva Unstoppable with an aim to enhance the goal of Digital India by introducing CSR intervention in Ed \ntech by implementing SBI Future Classroom initiative to provide smart classrooms among schools under SBI Card Smart Power \nSchool project.\nThis programme under the SBI Card Smart Power Schools project (SBI Card Future Classroom) aimed to create a digital learning \nzone for teachers and students in 11 government schools in Delhi-NCR to acquire skills like critical thinking, communication, \ncollaboration, and creativity by providing digital content for the curriculum for Science, Math, English (STEM based subjects) and \nother subjects of 6\nth\n to 8\nth\n grades. To further support the schools, the programme also engaged full time Google Certified Trainers \nfor a period of one year to train teachers and students to get hands on experience of the technology.\n11\nThe SBI Card support also included the following provisions\n12\n:\nThe Support provided by SBI Card in each school\nActivities Details \nInfrastructure\nColour work in SBI Card and Google future ClassroomsIncludes painting in the classroom. \nBenches in SBI Card Future classroom To improve the access to better furniture for the students in the classroom for \nimproved teaching learning facility.\nMultipurpose shadeTo enable the students to eat mid-day meals, play, pray and come together on various \nother occasions. \nEquipment\nSmart Classroom Includes smart board (KYAN- Interactive multimedia device with technical tool kits \ninclusive of large screen display device, CPU speaker etc.) \nChromebooks 15 Chromebooks and Console including charging rack, networking router, internet. \nCCTV Camera, Air conditioning and carpet Equipment support given to all the schools\nKey findings:\nImproved capacity of teachers in Ed-tech teaching method\nPrior to the initiative, all the teachers reported that there were no such skill enhancement opportunities for them to learn and \ngrow. Under the project, Yuva Unstoppable provided training to teachers where they have conducted sessions on how to teach the \nsubjects using smart classroom, digital content, audio-visual aid etc. This has helped in empowering the teachers on how to use"

Hence, they reported reinstalling \nsprinkler multiple times to cover their entire farm.\n •The beneficiaries reported that they were mostly growing the same crops which they used to grow before the project \nsupport: mustard, radish, onion, tomato, potato, brinjal, pearl millet (bajra), sorghum (jowar), cauliflower, ridge gourd. During \nthe discussion, few of the respondents reported to be growing wheat. It was highlighted by the beneficiaries that the crops \ngrown using sprinkler system have higher production and better taste compared to flood irrigation.\n •The beneficiaries informed that flood irrigation was water, energy, and time intensive. It was reported by the beneficiaries that \nit took 20 hours and approximately 901 litres of water for one irrigation cycle before the project, which has reduced to 10 \nhours and almost 413 litres post the project.

Patients availed MMU \nservices in their locality on weekly basis, which resulted in zero loss in their daily wages. This in turn also helped in saving the \ntime as well as travel cost to nearest government / private health facility.\n •Among those who went to private clinics, local quack doctors, or chemists, it was reported that they needed to incur a \nmedian cost of INR 50 on temperature screening, INR 300 on POC tests and around INR 300 when buying medicines for \nall the ailments. Most of the women respondents reported that it would have costed them a median cost of INR 600 for \navailing any ANC / PNC related consultation and support. The beneficiaries used the saved money in children’s education \nas reported by implementation partner field teams.\n •At the MMU, it was reported that the time required for consultation was very less, as depicted in figure 11, and thus \nthere was no requirement of taking a leave from work resulting in saving of both cost and time. Further to this, none of the \nbeneficiary has reported to have incurred any economic loss due to availing services from MMU.\nAddressing community necessities through MMU\n •Almost all the beneficiaries reported that MMU helped saving time and cost, followed by providing facilities such as free \nmedicines, free consultation, doorstep availability of services. Additionally, the reported benefits also included free instant \nPOC (rapid) tests (76%), early diagnosis of medical condition (49%) and referral for severe cases (64%). These additional \nthree benefits further help in communicating the importance of early diagnosis, referral and timely testing which is a key part \nof the programme aiming at behavioural change in the community.\n •Availability of an Auxiliary Nurse Midwife (ANM) in the MMU had also helped in mobilising the female beneficiaries for antenatal \nand prenatal care along with critical care of infants. Haemoglobin and sugar tests were conducted along with regular check-\nups during the period of pregnancy for expectant mothers. Team also sensitised the husband and the family members of \nvarious government schemes relating to delivery and girl childbirth.\nIncreased awareness on health aspects\n •Beneficiaries who were able to recall awareness related activities, 95% of them reported that the content of IEC materials \nwere easy to understand  because  the  team  used  local  dialects,  simple  language  and  graphics to make the general \npublic understand.\n •The project ensured maximum exposure of the community towards healthy practices. The most recalled health awareness \ntopics among beneficiaries included hand washing (99%), nutrition (99%), ANC / PNC (89%), communicable diseases \n(86%) and mother child health care (86%), and menstrual hygiene (85%)."

Based on the type \nof projects, due to unavailability of the baseline data, comparative analysis could not be done. However, to the extent possible we \nhave used retrospective indicators for the same. The limitations are as below:\n •In Project 2 (Home Based Management of COVID-19), due to the nature of the study, data confidentiality of the COVID-19 \npositive patients was maintained. Hence, interactions with the beneficiaries were not conducted, which limited the study findings \nin evaluating the comprehensive impact of the intervention.\n •In Project 3 (Support rescue for 400+ abandoned, destitute & homeless elderly across Delhi/NCR and food, medical \ncare, and recreational activities for 200+ uniquely identified elderly beneficiaries at SHEOWS facilities in Delhi and \nGarhmukhteshwar, Uttar Pradesh.), due to the medical conditions (Alzheimer, dementia) of the beneficiaries only brief \ninteractions were possible. Hence, detailed discussion was not possible to assess on their individual areas of impact created in \nthe lives of the beneficiaries but overall discussions with other stakeholders were carried out.\nCorporate Overview\n1\nStatutory Reports\n2\nFinancial Statements\n3\n141\nIntegrated Annual Report 2023-24"

Hence, in consultation with the SBI \nCard team and Sri Sathya Sai team, the PW team conducted interactions with the parents/guardians. Consequently, the findings \nof the study were based on the viewpoints of the parents/guardians and depends on the inputs of the other stakeholders.\n •In Project 5 (Enabling lives through mobility), the beneficiary turnout for physical interactions was low due to weather \nconditions in Chennai during the field visit. To reach the required sample size, the interactions were conducted physically as \nwell as through telephonic interactions to capture the views of the beneficiaries.\n •In Project 8 (SBI Cards Smart Power Schools -SBI Card Future Classroom), during the time of assessment, the team faced \nthe difficulty of reaching out to the teachers as many of them were transferred to non-intervention schools. Hence, the team \nwas able to interact with only nine out of the twelve proposed in the initial approach.\n •As Project 10 (For providing primary healthcare facility to needy & under privileged people through Mobile medical unit \n– ‘Smile on Wheels’) ended, almost all the field team members (doctor, nurse, ANM, community mobiliser) moved on to other \njobs / projects. Hence, it was difficult to establish contact and interact with them However, we were able to interact with one \nof the doctors, program coordinator and a community mobiliser.\nThe study has been conducted based on the time mentioned and agreed as period of assessment for the respective project’s \nconsultation with SBI Card and the impact assessed is for the said period only.\nPlease refer to section 2 and 3 for the detailed background, approach, and methodology and Section 4 onwards for the project \nwise findings and recommendations in the detailed report.\n142\nSBI Cards and Payment Services Limited"

CFL bulbs have been replaced with LED lights \n2.     LED light sensors installed at SBI Card offices \n3.       All  conventional  lamp-based  projectors  have  been  replaced  with  LED  displays, \nresulting in low power consumption and less E-waste generation.\n4.       Timely upgradation of HVAC units, UPS, and other electronic devices to ensure lower \nelectrical consumption.\n5.       Automatic VRV units installed in our offices (wherever possible), resulting in lower \nconsumption of electricity.\n6.     Weekly cleaning of AC air filters to reduce electrical consumption.\n7.     Installed sensor-based taps to reduce water wastage.\n8.       Instead  of  standees  and  posters,  we  use  digital  medium  to  display  internal \ncommunication resulting in reduction of paper consumption.\nReduction in Electricity, \nwater and Paper \nconsumption.\n2AutomationThere are total 16 AHUs (Air Handling units) installed by Gurgaon Building Management \nin Tower B&C Gurgaon to maintain required temperature at floors, which consumes ~9 \nlacs KWH of electricity annually. An automation is introduced for effective management \nof AHUs by upgrading the variable frequency driver and installation of remote controls \nat control panel of AHUs. The installed technology controls AHU motor speed by sensing \nAC  temperature  at  floor  and  accordingly  varies  motor  speed  to  maintain  required \ntemperature at floor. The initiative will save ~90,000 KWH of electricity per annum.\nReduction in electricity \nand emissions\n3DigitalisationSBI Card embraced to digital transformation to minimise the environmental impact of \ntraditional paper-based processes. By promoting digital alternatives such as e-statements, \nonline  transactions,  and  virtual  customer  interactions,  we  aim  to  reduce  waste  and \nconserve resources. \nSBI Card undertook digitisation of its key customer touchpoints, rolled out membership \ne-kits, and bolstered the Sales 24 platform for strengthening digital sourcing.\nReduction in paper \nwaste, emissions\n5.

A \ncompany's internal financial control with reference to financial \nstatements includes those policies and procedures that (1) \npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, \naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of \nthe assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that \ntransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation \nof financial statements in accordance with generally accepted \naccounting  principles,  and  that  receipts  and  expenditures \nof  the  company  are  being  made  only  in  accordance  with \nauthorisations of management and directors of the company; \nand (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or \ntimely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition \nof the company's assets that could have a material effect on the \nfinancial statements.\nINHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL \nCONTROLS WITH REFERENCE TO FINANCIAL \nSTATEMENTS\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls \nwith reference to financial statements, including the possibility \nof collusion or improper management override of controls, \nmaterial misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not \nbe detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal \nfinancial controls with reference to financial statements to \nfuture periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial \ncontrol with reference to financial statements may become \ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree \nof compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n218\nSBI Cards and Payment Services Limited"

This amount is reflected under the head \n‘Impairment on financial instruments’ in the Statement of \nProfit and Loss. On the other side, for financial assets \nmeasured as at amortised cost, ECL is presented as an \nallowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of \nthose assets in the balance sheet.

Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability \nwhenever events or changes in circumstances indicate \nthat their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The \nright-of-use assets is presented as a separate line item in \nthe balance sheet.\n  For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable \namount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell \nand the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset \nbasis unless the asset does not generate cash flows that \nare largely independent of those from other assets. In \nsuch cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the \nCash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.\n  The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at \nthe present value of the future lease payments. The lease \npayments include fixed payments (including in-substance \nfixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, \nvariable lease payment that depends on index or a rate, \nand amount to be paid under residual value guarantees. \nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest \nrate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, \nthe Company uses incremental borrowing rates.\n  The  interest  cost  on  lease  liability  (computed  using \neffective  interest  method),  is  expensed  off  in  the  \nstatement of profit and loss and the lease liability is \nsubsequently  measured  by  increasing  the  carrying \namount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the \neffective interest method) and by reducing the carrying \namount to reflect the lease payments made.\n  The lease liability is presented as a separate line item in \nthe other financial liability as part of the balance sheet.\n  Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding \nadjustment  to  the  related  right  of  use  asset  if  the \nCompany  changes  its  assessment  if  whether  it  will \nexercise an extension or a termination option. \n4.9.

Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported \nin profit or loss because it excludes items of income or \nexpense that are taxable or deductible in other years \nand it further excludes items that are never taxable \nor deductible.\n  Current income tax, assets and liabilities are measured at \nthe amount expected to be paid to or recovered from the \ntaxation authorities in accordance with the Income Tax \nAct, 1961 and the Income Computation and Disclosure \nStandards (ICDS) enacted in India by using tax rates \nprescribed therein. The tax rates and tax laws used \nto  compute  the  amount  are  those  that  are  enacted  or  \nsubstantively enacted, at the reporting date\n  Current income tax relating to item recognised outside \nthe statement of profit and loss is recognised outside \nprofit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or \nequity). Current tax items are recognised in correlation \nto the underlying transactions either in OCI or directly \nin equity.\n Deferred Tax\n  Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on \ntemporary differences between the tax bases of assets \nand liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial \nreporting  purposes  at  the  reporting  date.  Deferred \ntax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary \ndifferences.  Deferred  tax  assets  are  recognised  to \nthe extent that it is probable that taxable profit will \nbe available against which the deductible temporary \ndifferences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits \nand unused tax losses can be utilised.\n  The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed \nat each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it \nis no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will \nbe available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset \nto be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are re-\nassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to \nthe extent that it has become probable that future taxable \nprofits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax \nrates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset \nis realised, or the liability is settled, based on tax rates \n234\nSBI Cards and Payment Services Limited"

An actuarial valuation \ninvolves making various assumptions that may \ndiffer from actual developments in the future. \nThese include the determination of the discount \nrate; future salary increases and mortality rates. \nDue to the complexities involved in the valuation \nand  its  long-term  nature,  a  defined  benefit \nobligation is highly sensitive to changes in these \nassumptions.

In \nassessing whether the Company is reasonably certain to \nexercise an option to extend a lease, or not to exercise an \noption to terminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts \nand circumstances that create an economic incentive for \nthe Company to exercise the option to extend the lease, \nor not to exercise the option to terminate the lease. The \nCompany revises the lease term if there is a change in \nthe non-cancellable period of a lease. The discount rate \nis generally based on the incremental borrowing rate \nspecific to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of \nleases with similar characteristics.\n4.17.

Quantitative analysis such as net income sensitivities, stress tests etc. are used to monitor and manage Company’s \nmarket risk appetite.\n A. Interest risk\n         Interest rate risk is the risk of loss from fluctuations in the future cash flows or fair value of financial instruments because \nof changes in market interest rates.\n         Company's investments are categorised under HTM (Held to Maturity) category. Investments are done in Government \nsecurities (T-Bill/ G Sec) only, hence there is no credit risk involved. To monitor the interest rate risk, Treasury function \nmonitors the modified duration of these investments on monthly basis and report the same to Enterprise Risk Management \nCommittee through KRI reporting. Further, Company has fixed as well as floating rate borrowings to which it is exposed \nto interest rate risk as well as repricing risk at the time of re-borrowing.\n     The below table shows the interest rate sensitivity for a period up to one year:\nDescription\nAs at \nMarch 31, 2024\nAs at \nMarch 31, 2023\nAssets 44,860.38  35,885.09 \nLiabilities 35,156.43  25,554.60 \nVariation 9,703.95  10,330.49 \n  Interest rate sensitivity analysis\nThe below table presents the impact on Profit / (Loss) before tax for increase or decrease in interest rate under below \nstated scenarios on Company’s interest rates liabilities and assets (upto twelve months) which are open to repricing risk \n(assuming all other variables are held constant):\nDecription\nAs at March 31, 2024As at March 31, 2023\nIncrease DecreaseIncrease Decrease\n50 bps Impact on Profit on variation shown above (23.41) 23.41  (22.12)22.12\n100 bps Impact on Profit on variation shown above (46.82) 46.82  (44.24)44.24\n200 bps Impact on Profit on variation shown above (93.65) 93.65  (88.48)88.48\nThe above sensitivity analysis is prepared assuming the amount outstanding at the end of the reporting period was \noutstanding for the whole year.

The \nassessment of credit risk of a portfolio of assets entails further estimations as to likelihood of defaults occurring, \nof the associated loss ratios, collaterals and coverage ratio etc.\n             The Company measures credit risk using Probability of Default (PD), Exposure of Default (EAD), Loss Given Default \n(LGD). Ind-AS 109 outlines a three staged model for measurement of impairment based on changes in credit risk \nsince initial recognition.\n •A financial instrument that is not credit impaired on initial recognition is classified in 'Stage 1',\n •If a Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) is identified the financial instrument moves to 'Stage 2',\n •If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, the financial instrument moves to 'Stage 3' category.\n             The Company uses multiple economic factors to measure the ECL on a forward looking basis.\n             Some of these factors include GDP growth rate, bank credit to specific sectors, Wholesale Price Index (WPI), \nConsumer Price Index (CPI), currency circulation. Correlations have been tested with past NPA trends.\n             Factors where management views the correlations to be acceptable are then used to assess the extent of impact \non the portfolio.\n             The RBI Financial Stability Report (FSR) is used as an indicator of future economic scenario. The impact of these \nscenarios is then transmitted back into our ECL model basis the factors with acceptable correlations which enables \nthe Company to ensure that adverse future economic conditions are covered in the ECL. \n             The Company defines default or Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) based on the following quantitative and \nqualitative criteria.\n         Definition of Default\n                     Quantitative       criteria\n         The borrower is more than 90 days past due on its contractual payments.\n                     Qualitative       criteria\n             The borrower meets unlikeliness to pay criteria, which indicates that the borrower is in significant difficulty wherein \na 'hard block' is applied on accounts and is blocked for further activity on meeting the following criteria;\n•   Arrangement to Pay\n•   Settlement\n•   Cardholder is deceased\n•   Restructured\n         Further, for any borrower to be upgraded from Stage 3, the entire overdue balance on all accounts, must be cleared.\n         Definition of Significant increase in credit risk (SICR)\n                     Quantitative       criteria\n         The borrower is 30-90 past due on its contractual payments.\n282"

The \nRetail Unsecured segment PDs are further derived by evaluating the PDs at a sub-segment level basis credit history \ni.e. New to Credit (NTC), New to Credit Card (NTCC) and Carded. These sub-segmented PDs are then rolled up to \narrive at the overall retail unsecured PD\nLGD\n      All discounted recoveries net of collection costs is calculated segment wise against exposures to arrive at loss \nestimates. Discount rate being considered is the average yield rate across segments. LGD is floored at 0% and \ncapped at 100%\n                     EAD\nSegment wise EAD is calculated using the below formula:\n   EAD = Balance Outstanding + CCF*(Credit Limit – Balance Outstanding), where CCF is proportion of unutilised credit \nlimit which is expected to be utilised till the time of default. CCF is applicable only for stage 1 accounts, as stage 2 \nand stage 3 accounts cannot utilise the unused credit limit. CCF % = Utilisation (t+12) – Utilisation (t) i.e. change \nof utilisation rates over next 1 year, its being floored at 0%.\n         The Company recalibrates the components of ECL model at regular intervals using,\n         1.

ALCO is responsible for managing the Company’s liquidity risk via a \ncombination of policy formation, review and governance, analysis, stress testing, limit setting and monitoring.\n        Company’s borrowing program is rated by CRISIL & ICRA.

SBI Card Employee Stock Option Plan 2023 (the Plan)\n        On August 09, 2023, pursuant to approval by the shareholders in the Annual General Meeting, the Board has been authorised \nto introduce, offer, issue and provide share-based incentives to eligible employees of the Company under the Plan.\n        Under the plan, two types of employee stock options are granted, performance share units and restricted share units. During \nthe year ended March 31, 2024, Performance share units and restricted share units were granted on October 18, 2023. Each \nemployee stock option converts into one equity share of the Company on exercise.\n        Performance based options shall vest with the participants upon completion of 3 years from the grant date. Restriction \nbased options shall vest with the participants in 3 tranches: – 30%, 30%, 40% at the end of year 1, 2, 3 of continued service \nrespectively. However, vesting of options shall be contingent upon the Participant being employed with the Company and few \nother defined annual performance parameters.\n        Performance parameters will be set annually and approved by the Nomination and Remuneration Committee (NRC) and \napproved parameters for each financial year will be notified to the employees. Further, the NRC and Board holds the power \nto modify targets between the date of grant and vesting Date.\n        As per Ind AS 102, for the purpose of accounting grant date is considered as the date when performance parameters are \napproved and notified to the employees by NRC. Fair value of the equity instruments is estimated (i.e., by reference to the \nfair value of the equity instruments at the end of the reporting period) for the purpose of recognising the services received \nduring the period between the date of commencement of service (i.e. October 18, 2023) and the grant date as per Ind AS 102. \nOn occurrence of the grant date, the Company revises the earlier estimate of fair value to ultimately recognise the expense \nin relation to such grant, based on the grant date fair value.\ni)  Summary of options granted under plan:\nType of arrangement\nAs at March 31, 2024As at March 31, 2023\nAvg exercise \nprice per \nshare option \n(in `)\nNumber of \noptions\nVesting \nPeriod\nAvg exercise \nprice per \nshare option \n(in `)\nNumber of \noptions\nVesting \nPeriod\nOpening balance -  -    -    -    -   \nOptions Granted during the year\nPSU options granted during the year 10.00  225,273  3 year  -    -    -   \nRSU options granted during the year\nTranche 1 10.00  103,981  1 year  -    -    -   \nTranche 2 10.00  103,981  2 year  -    -    -   \nTranche 3 10.00  138,642  3 year  -    -    -   \nExercised during the year -    -    -  -    -    -   \nForfeited during the year -    -    -  -    -    -   \nExpired during the year -    -    -  -    -    -   \nClosing balance 10.00  571,877  -    -    -    -"

On the basis of said declaration, the Company has obtained \nopinion from legal firm confirming that the same can be treated as receipt of consideration in convertible foreign exchange \nand consequently as export of service and therefore not chargeable to GST. The Company has accordingly decided to stop \npaying GST on International Interchange henceforth and decided to file a refund application for ` 4.51 Crores for the GST paid \nfrom July 2017 to March 2018 with GST authorities.\n        The said refund is subject to interpretation of law for which there is no precedence in the form of judgements/ departmental \nclarifications. In view of the above, the Company has provided for 100% provision against the refund claim to mitigate the \nuncertainty risk.\n        Further, on February 21, 2023, the refund claim filed by the Company has been rejected by the GST authorities.

In respect \nof loans and advances in the nature of loans, the schedule \nof repayment of principal and interest payment for EMI \nportion of portfolio is stipulated, rest of the portfolio is \nNon EMI portion which do not constitute any schedule of \nrepayment. Having regard to the nature of the company's \nbusiness and the volume of information involved, it is not \npracticable to provide an itemized list of loan assets where \ndelinquencies in the repayment of principal and interest \nhave been identified. Further, except for the instances \nwhere there are delays or defaults in repayment of principal \nand/  or  interest  and  in  respect  of  which  the  Company  \nhas recognized necessary provisions in accordance with \nthe principles of Ind AS and the guidelines issued by RBI, \nthe parties in general are repaying the principal amounts, \nand are also generally regular in payment of interest, \nas applicable.\n    During  audit  scrutiny,  it  was  observed  that  during  the  \ncurrent year the customers under the EMI portion of \nportfolio defaulted against 8526 nos. of the accounts \namounting  to  ` 65.90 crore. However, the independent \nauditor  failed  to  report  the  same.  Therefore,  the \nIndependent Auditor's Report is deficient to that extent.\nFor and on behalf of the  \nComptroller & Auditor General of India\n (S.
